# **The Growth Mindset**

Growth mindset, in otherwords, having your mind growing further, it's an interesting topic especially for us, programmers. Any programmer aim to be a successful person, and without development to his skills, it will be tough to develop and that's where Mindset growth come to use, it helps you to get out of your comfort zone and start right away with challenges above your knowledge level that will open new aspects and ways of thinking, resulting in polisihing your current skills and developing new set of skills that will help you in solving problems.

Reading the article [Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)

I learned much about deliberate practice, which means not practicing what you already mastered would get you to the next level, but getting out of your comfort zone and challenging yourself which will!, so I encountered questions of what I would like to learn next! and I would answer that question by saying that I wanted to learn Java programming language but I heard it's hard to learn, and supposed to learn C++ before it, So it was a bit of fear stopping me to do it, though after reading the article I decided to take a start of that journey.

Talking about the emotional intellegence and Biases, I did the tests and came a conclusion of which aspects I should work on to improve

## Emotional Intellegence

    I found that my strength point is self-managements, while other aspects such as social awareness, relationship management needs a bit of work on myself to enhance them, on the otherhand my weak point was self-awareness which I scored the lowest and it needs much of work and me focusing on it to reach the practical skill and start thinking of my acts more before doing them and how my emotions affecting it.

## Biases

    Talking about biases, I found myself on a good scoring level almost the highest range, so still I lack some improvments that I should make, my highest field score was (Connect to mitigate Bias) while my worst was (Four ways to act with courage) so I should work more on the last to improve myself at this point since it was related with getting involved with teammates and organization that is so much required to be a successful co-worker, also other weak point which I decided to work on first is (empathy and curiosity) to express more of support to people and to gain their respect too as a helpful teammate or connection.

## Videos content

    Starting with Carol Dweck video, I really enjoyed how she was talking based on reasearch and results, and I really admired the idea of "YET", and how the results shown that teaching kids that failure isn't a stop point, no, it's a development process that enhance your brain capabilities to exceed it's limit and be smarter!, then Angela Lee Duckworth on the second video just was in a complete agreement with Carol's statement, and concluded that results shown the successful person main attribute was being GRIT, not talent, not background. it's all about being gritty! challenging your limits to learn more and never stop as a marathon. Then lastly Alain de botton with his philosophical apprach defined how success works and how we define it based on what we absorb from the surrounded area and it differs from environment to another, also concluding that success had different definition, it's not a fixed one!

## Things I want to know more about

- I would like to learn more about the mentality aspect of successful persons, how they manage their time and how they keep up the motivation during their journey.
- Also I want to know which is better? mastering one programming language at a time then go for the next one or while working with one, go and learn another commonly used one? cause as I see the marketplace they usually require a developer who has knowledge with multiple languages.
