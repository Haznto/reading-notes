# ***Data Structures and Algorithms***

>Data Structures and Algorithms is a fundemental base block in each programmers journey to know about, since it is a technology almost used in every single application to handle data effectively and do operations on that data easier. DSA also important for each programmer since it's a 100% question in job interviews.

## ***What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?***

> The most important thing is to check the pros and cons of each data structure type using it on solving that problem, choosing the most suitible one depends on many aspects like the simplicity to use, performance and saving time by reducing the number of operations needed to solve that problem also the memory needed to operate over that problem using that certain data structure. Also each data structure is mainly used to be applied on a certain type of problems, so matching between the problem and the data structure application is one of the important things to do.

## ***How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?***

> by using a base case (usually conditional that will stop the recursive function when that conditional is met.)

## ***Things I want to know more about***

>I would like to understand how to apply or get benefit from these data structures in real life projects since I have no idea about how they makes thing more effective and easier. also I want to understand more about the bigO what's exactly meant by space and time efficacy.
