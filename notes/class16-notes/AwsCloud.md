# AWS Cloud Service

## AWS EC2

What is an EC2 Instance?

>it's a virtual computing environment but on cloud, it helps to manage your application building processes and services with the ability of use on multiple operating systems, so instead of building your server on your local place, you could do that on a cloud not caring about the infrastructure to provide for your server.

Name 2 use cases for EC2.

> - Train and deploy ML applications
> - Develop for Apple platforms

Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.

>EC2 has much features over Heroku for example, and it is made actually for scalable companies with large business that needs lots of requirements and speed, which EC2 beats the other clouding hosting platforms for such projects. other wise for small projects you can use the others, on other aspect too, EC2 give you the whole control over your projects instances.

## EC2 For Humans

Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?

>Under the compute section

Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.
>The difference is in term of specification, as the size (micro , small ,medium, large) increases, these specifications increase of the similar machine type. micro for example has  1 cpu and 1 gigabyte of ram, while large has 2 Cpu and 8 gigabyte of ram so it's stronger.

Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.

>Computing cycle is like, translation, when you talk to your friend, your friend brain is the processor, same as for computer cpu, it gets the words by listening and then it do complex process to get the meaning of what you said, then reply to what you said either by a word or an act, same for the computer, once you do an operation, for example typing on the keyboard, the processor fetch that operation and decode it to it's understandable language, then it returns to you a response back encoded to your language or the act you would understand like showing you the words you typed.

## Elastic Beanstalk

What is Elastic Beanstalk?
>an easy to use service to deploy, manage and scales web applications for your.

Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.

>Elasticbeans are working over EC2 instances, they follow the rules of it to deploy the server, so it is integrated.

Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.

>Supports multiple languages environment and and servers and support scalability of devices despite the need of upgrading the machine each time.
