# React Native

## Getting started with react native

***Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.***

>- View component, it's the building block of any React Native application, it's like a container, rectangular one to contain other components inside it.
>- Text component, a component that renders text
>- Image component, a component to render images.

***What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?***

>For developement of application that are android based, usually we use Java or Kotlin, and for iOS we use Swift for example, now with react native, we only use react to build the corresponding elements in both iOS and Android using javascript.

***What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?***

>The building blocks of React Native app are views, which are like rectangular containers that contain any other elements, while in React app the components are the building blocks, it's almost the same concept, every single element on the screen with be represented by a view.

## Expo

***What solution does expo provide?***

>It's provides a simple environment to develop mobile apps using React native such as a CLI and web-based IDE, it also offers pre-built components ready to use in apps.

***Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.***

>Managed

***What is the difference between React Native and Expo?***

>Expo is built over React Native, while expo gives you the faster developement process and easier to deal with approach, React Native give you the freedom to create your native components freely.

## Expo snack

***Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?***

>Expo snack is like a web IDE allows you to build mobile React Native application on your browser.

## Ejecting

***What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?***

 >Describe leaving the cozy comfort of the standard Expo development environment, where you do not have to deal with build configuration or native code( in simple words, you go back to your React native pure approach).

***When should you not eject?***

>If you need a simple managed workflow and no customization

***Why might you choose to eject?***

>If customization is a must.
