# S3 and Lambda

## AWS: S3

What is Amazon S3?
>It's object storage, to store your data from anywhere and retrieve it, or duplicate it and send it to other regions using cost effective classes.

Name some use cases for Amazon S3.

>- build a data lake.
>- backup and restore critical data.
>- archive data at the lowest cost.

Name some benefits of using Amazon S3.

>It offers security and scalability, allowing you to control how data will be accessed, also the cost effectivness of the storage not forgetting about data transferring and replication.

## AWS: Lambda

What is AWS Lambda?

>It's like a ready to use coding environment where you can write your code as functions to execute using one of the supported languages or runtimes to build up your application with the need of taking care of your physical infrastructure like the server.

Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.

>- Scalable APIs.
>- Data processing, based on event based data(good for counters, notifications and analyitics).

Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.

>Breaking it down into analogy, serverless means no need for physical parts building a server, imagine that you are in school physically, to make actions or to go through activities, you have to prepare rooms and tools to make that event happen, while if your school was on online platform, there is no need for the these preparations and physical requirement needed to make an event, so it will be time effective and cost effective for making that event happen. this is exactly what Lambda offers.

## CDN

What is a CDN?

>It's a short for Contnet Delivery Network, which means multiple servers (super computers to serve information) distributed around the world to deliver information in a faster way due to the distance factor reduction.

How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?

>When a website visitor sends a request, the originated server defines the location of that request and redirect the request back to the closest CDN to that user, making the whole process of fetching the data happens from a shorter distance to the user, therefore it will be faster.

What are the benefits of employing a CDN?

>the benefits are many, including faster responses, reducing traffic over the main server, increasing the security against DoS for example, and thinking of it logically the load is distributed over multiple servers making the life-time cycle of the server longer for everyone so reducing the cost at times in terms of maintanence.

## Things I want to know more about

- How to exactly use the buckets to store data using S3 and to practice the context of labmda functions building event driven applications.
