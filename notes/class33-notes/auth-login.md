# RBAC - Auth - Login

## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

>- It is a system to control accessing data based on a hypothetical assigned role for the user. the authorizations differs based on the role, so making it easier for the website/company to identify who can do what and prevent bad information access and randomness.

Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.

>For Example let's say a website that simulates an Airplane.

Roles are :

1- Pilot

2- Passenger

3- Cabin Crew
>

>*Pilot could do all the CRUDs (Create,Read,Update,Delete) any flight.*

>*Passenger could Read the flights(Only Read).*

>*Cabin Crew could Read, Update the flights info based on the services they are providing for that flight(for example 5 stars service.)(Read, Update).*

What are the Benefits of RBAC?

>- Reducing administrative work and IT support: instead of making 1 account with a certain role and authorities, then once the person who worked on that account retire we have to change the password, no the next step will be easier, just by changing that account role to a standard role with minimal authorizations.

>- Maximizing operational efficiency:
Each user could get an account and authority that suits his current organization position and work nature.

>- Improving compliance: It will make it more secure for the clients that only the right sides will be able to access their data and not everyone. like in a hospital, a patient would be compliant knowing that only his physician will access his data.

## Cookies-Libraries

Describe some react-cookie features.

>Reading the package, it has a structure similar to react syntax, as hooks of Context, State and such things, also a feature for it that it has more dependants which means more libraries are using this library and rely on it, which also make it has bigger fanbase and keep updating it, so it has more versions, about 70 versions has been released

Describe some react-cookies features.

>It has a select method by regex which will find all cookies with matching regex other features also included in the other library so nothing makes this one special

Which library would you prefer would you prefer? Why?

>React-cookie is the one for me, since it has much simpler Syntax that matches the React style, also has more users and updates more often, so I would go with it to use.
