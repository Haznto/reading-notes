# Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## Async actions

**Why use Redux middleware?**

>Redux middleware helps with tasks like getting data from the internet or keeping track of actions, making our app organized. It's like a helper that stands between what users do and how our data gets updated.

**Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.:**

>In Redux, when a user takes an action, like clicking a button, it starts a series of events. First, a message is sent (called a dispatch action). This message can be simple or complex. It goes through middleware, which can do things like fetching data. After that, real actions are sent out once the tasks are done, and these actions change the app's look and feel.

**How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?**

>To handle time-consuming tasks, Redux uses Thunk middleware. Thunk functions are like special instructions for handling these tasks. When you ask for something, Thunk follows the instructions and gets it for you. It helps Redux work smoothly with these slow tasks while keeping everything organized.

## Thunk middleware

**Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?**

>Redux-thunk is necessary to manage asynchronous operations in a Redux app. It allows you to create action creators that can do tasks like making API requests or managing side effects before sending actual actions. Without redux-thunk, dealing with async logic in Redux would be tricky, and you might have problems with timing and updating the app's state.

**Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action.**

>a function

**Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.**

>The return value from the inner thunk function is available through Redux's dispatch and getState functions, which are provided to the thunk. Thunks can use these functions to dispatch actions with updated data or manage the state based on the result of the async operation.
