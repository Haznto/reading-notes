# useEffect()

**What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?**

>Connecting to an external system

**How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?**

>Once your component becomes part of the DOM, React executes your setup function of the useEffect. Following each re-render involving altered dependencies, React initiates the cleanup function first (if supplied), utilizing the previous values, and subsequently calls your setup function using the updated values. Upon the removal of your component from the DOM, React triggers your cleanup function.

**What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?**

>The return value from the effect's logic function is used to clean up after the effect. This is particularly important to prevent memory leaks or unintended behavior.
