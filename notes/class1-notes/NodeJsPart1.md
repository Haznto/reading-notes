# Node.js

Node.js which is an entrepreneur technology that made programming and making back end servers a lot easier, it's an important technology to learn, as It made it easier to use only one language to deal with data from both the client side and the server side which is (JavaScript). Also it has fixed the delay and slugginish of servers as it works.

## How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

- there are many lanagues in the word and computers use ones too, there are a lanuage we programmers use called JavaScript and the computers don't directly understand it, so there is a middleware called Node which works as an interpretter (Compiler) that explains the meaning of JavaScirpt words to the computer so it can understand what the programmer order from it.

## What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

- It is an environment area (software) where the programmer(user) is allowed to execute code using JavaScirpt directly on his machine instead of working on the browser only and it supports the lates version and syntax of JavaScirpt.

## What is Node used for?

it's mainly used to build up JavaScript applications freely, it is like a barebone that you can customize based on the packages you install using npm that would be suitable while building your customized project. it has also other uses such as using it as a scrpiting language, wrting customized command lines and making your own robots too!

## What do you look forward to learning?

Actually I am looking forward for the 4th module about AWS. also learning more about REST API.

## What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

My goals are to learn each detail and hopefully to learn it in an interesting way what would make it stick in our minds, so we can use it with comprehending and not memeorizing.
